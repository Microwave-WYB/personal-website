				Detecting Vulnerable Critical Infrastructures with Wardriving Data Collection and Computer Vision (Summer 2022 - Present)
			</h3>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: Computer Vision, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Python
			<p>
				Short range wireless links are used in many critical infrastructures, such as traffic lights, capacitors, and reclosers. These wireless links are vulnerable to attacks. In this project, we use wardriving data collection and computer vision to detect vulnerable critical infrastructures. We use wardriving data collection to map the locations of wireless links. We use computer vision to detect the critical infrastructures. We use the wardriving data and computer vision results to detect vulnerable critical infrastructures.

				Router Implementation in C
			</h3>
			<strong>Keywords</strong>: C, Computer Networks, Data Structures, Optimization
			<p>
				In CSE123 Computer Networks, I implemeted a router which accepts ARP, ICMP, and IP packets and forwards them to the correct destination. I implemented the router using C and optimized the router with various data structures and algorithms. My implementation outperformed all peers in the class, and I won the 2022 George Varghese UCSD CSE Espresso Prize.
